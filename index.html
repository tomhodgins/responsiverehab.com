  <h2>Web Design Consultation</h2>
  <p class=jumbo><img src=//i.imgur.com/PKYFzK8.jpg alt="Tommy Hodgins">Hi, my name's <a href="//twitter.com/intent/follow/?screen_name=innovati" title="Follow Tommy Hodgins on Twitter">Tommy Hodgins</a>. I’m a trained graphic designer, and I've been building websites for over a decade. Let me put the skills and expertise I've learned to work for you!</p>
  <p>I specialize in responsive web design, and most of my work is focused around taking websites that already exist and making them work better responsively.</p>
  <p>You may know me from my experiments with <a href=//elementqueries.com title="EQCSS website">EQCSS</a> and Element Queries, or from my <a href=//codepen.io/tomhodgins/pens/popular/ title="My Codepen">demos on CodePen</a>. I also research new responsive design ideas and I also <a href=//www.youtube.com/user/innovati/videos title="innovati on YouTube">make videos</a> and <a href=//codepen.io/tomhodgins/posts/published/ title="My blog posts on Codepen">write blog posts</a> about the techniques I discover, and <a href=//github.com/tomhodgins title="My Github">write plugins</a> to help people use the techniques I find.</p>

  <h2>How I Can Help You?</h2>
  <p>If you have a website that makes money for your business, imagine what boosting your conversion by a few percent could do for you in the long term. In the past, I've been able to raise conversion rates by as much as 10%, and have also helped clients recover money they were losing, simply by applying a few easy-to-implement design tweaks to their existing sites that allowed their designs to adapt better to tablets and phones.</p>

  <h2>What You Get:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li data-bullet="🎬">A video screen capture of me reviewing your website
    <li data-bullet="📝">A list of action steps you can take to improve your website
    <li data-bullet="🎛">Plugin, tool, & workflow recommendations
    <li data-bullet="🎨">Responsive technique examples to help your site
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <p class=jumbo>How much does a consultation cost?</p>
  <p>The rate is $100 for a video review of one website, plus the other deliverables listed above: list of action steps, software recommendations, and responsive technique demonstrations.</p>
  <p>If you have other consultation needs that don't fit the list above, <a href="mailto:tomhodgins@gmail.com" title="Send me an email">contact me directly</a> to see how I can help you.</p>

  <p class=jumbo>How long does it take?</p>
  <p>Once you have booked your consultation, I will contact you with an estimate of how long it will take to complete the review and deliverables. I will ask about which parts of your site you would like me to focus on, and you will have an opportunity to share any further details with me before the review process begins.</p>

  <p class=jumbo>What do I do after my consultation?</p>
  <p>The site review I create for you will be communicated in plain language to make sure that you understand what can be improved. The technical recommendations and code samples will be presented in a way that developers will be able to clearly understand.</p>
  <p>Once you have the review, recommendations, and any sample code, you may be able to implement the changes yourself. If not, you are welcome to hire me, or any other web developer, to help make these changes for you.</p>
